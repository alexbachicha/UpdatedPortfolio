## Description

My name is Alex Bachicha. I am part of UC Davis's Part-Time Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. This is my [Deployed Professional Web Developer Portfolio](https://alexbachicha.github.io/UpdatedPortfolio/). While it is still a work in progress, I am learning more about how I want to present myself with each project I work on. As new projects develop, my page will update to showcase these endeavors.
